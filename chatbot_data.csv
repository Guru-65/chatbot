Question,Answer
What is deep learning?,Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers.
What is a neural network?,A neural network is a series of algorithms that mimic the operations of a human brain to recognize relationships in data.
What is the difference between deep learning and machine learning?,Deep learning uses multiple layers of neural networks while machine learning relies on shallow models.
What is supervised learning?,Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data.
What is unsupervised learning?,Unsupervised learning is where the model finds patterns in unlabeled data.
What is a convolutional neural network?,A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model used primarily for image processing.
What is a recurrent neural network?,A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data.
What is overfitting?,Overfitting is when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
What is underfitting?,Underfitting is when a model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data.
What is backpropagation?,Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train neural networks by minimizing the error through gradient descent.
What is an activation function?,"An activation function introduces non-linearity into the model, helping it learn complex patterns."
What is dropout in deep learning?,Dropout is a regularization technique where random neurons are ignored during training to prevent overfitting.
What is the vanishing gradient problem?,"The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients become too small, making it difficult for the model to learn."
What is transfer learning?,Transfer learning is a method where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.
What is a loss function?,A loss function is used to measure how well the model is performing by comparing predicted and actual outputs.
What is TensorFlow?,TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google.
What is PyTorch?,"PyTorch is an open-source deep learning library developed by Facebook, popular for its dynamic computation graph."
What is a GPU?,"A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a processor designed to handle many operations in parallel, useful for deep learning training."
What is batch size?,Batch size is the number of training examples used in one iteration of model training.
What is an epoch?,An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset.
